In India, agriculture plays a predominant role in the economy and employment. Farmers do not choose the right crops to plant based on the soil requirements of their land, so they produce far less than they might otherwise. AgriGenie provides a solution for the same. AgriGenie is a modern farming technique that uses research data about soil characteristics, soil types, and crop yield data collection to suggest the right crop for each farm's specific characteristics. 
Helping the farmers understand requirements and enlighten them would not only be beneficial for them, but also for our economy. This was the primary motive, ie. giving back to the community that we live in and maintain sustainable development. 
Moreover, my motive was to build an easily understandable and usable interface, because that would be a connecting factor between the product and the target audience.
